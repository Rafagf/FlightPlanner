# FlightPlanner

*Note: An article about FlightPlanner has been featured by [Kotlin Weekly (#241)](https://mailchi.mp/kotlinweekly/kotlin-weekly-241)*, thanks! üôè

[Flight planner](https://theflightplanner.herokuapp.com/) helps you keep track of your flights. It is a personal pet project that can be used as a guide to build a backend, api and a web using Ktor. I've described the whole process on this [article](https://www.rafagarcia.dev/development/building-a-backend-an-api-and-a-web-client-using-ktor/), which was featured by the official [Kotlin twitter account](https://twitter.com/kotlin/status/1384900249630740482) 
 
* **Backend + API**: [Ktor](https://ktor.io/) and [PostGresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). 

* **Front-End**: [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Free Marker](https://freemarker.apache.org/).

### API
Although the website does not use it, an API has been provided to login and add new flights. It uses [JWT](https://jwt.io/introduction/) for authentication. 

By doing a POST in */login* with your username and password you'll get your token to then do POST in */api/v1/flights* and add new flights into your account.

### Next steps
* Error handling is almost non-existent in the API side.
* No unit-tests
* The front-end could get a lot more love.
* Add more endpoints to the API (i.e POST */signup* or DELETE */flights/{userId}/{flightId}*)
* Build a mobile client (Android/iOS app).
